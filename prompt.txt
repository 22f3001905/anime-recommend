I want you to create a simple web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that shows the user a random anime using the API endpoint given: 

https://api.jikan.moe/v4/random/anime

There should be a button, when clicked fetches the URL and displays the data. It should be disabled as the data is fetched, after 200 status code enable it again.

You may use Bootstrap for styling and make sure it looks simple yet elegant.

Make sure to that the page has all the following after fetching the URL:

1. Image of the anime: href can be taken from data.images.jpg.image_url
2. Title of the anime: data.title
3. Anime type, source, episodes, status, duration, rating, score, scored_by, and synopsis. (all can be accessed within data.{attribute})

Think carefully before writing any code.
